# 3D Spirography
Lets user create a 3D spirograph pattern using Three js and WebGL

Launch program [here](https://shivaperi.github.io/3d_spirograph/)

# Demo
![Demo 1](https://github.com/shivaPeri/3d_spirograph/blob/master/examples/3d_spirograph_demo.gif)

# Usage Instructions
An assembly is edited by editing the controls on the selected sphere.
* Toggle *play* to run the machine.
* Use *add* and *remove* to create/destroy additional spheres
* Use the *selection* slider to toggle the selected sphere
* Use the *radius, d_alpha, d_beta* to edit attributes of the selected sphere

![Usage Demo](https://github.com/shivaPeri/3d_spirograph/blob/master/examples/3d_spirograph_usage_demo.gif)

# Spherical Coordinates
Each sphere has a d_alpha and d_beta, which controls the respective speeds of two axes of rotation.
