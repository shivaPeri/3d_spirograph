# 3d_spirograph
Lets user create a 3D spirograph pattern using WebGL
Launch here (https://shivaperi.github.io/3d_spirograph/)

# Demo
![Demo 1](https://github.com/shivaPeri/3d_spirograph/blob/master/examples/3d_spirograph_demo.gif)

# Usage Instructions
An assembly is edited by editing the controls on the selected sphere.

# Spherical Coordinates
Each sphere has a d_alpha and d_beta, which controls two axes of rotation.
